# Project-HTML-

Project HTML is a school project where we were supposed to reproduce the website of the IUT of Toulouse. 

My part of it consisted of create the home page of the website 
This homepage has 4 sections, each of them based on a particular topic. 
Enjoy it and remember that if you're on the beginning of your IT/computer science journey, everyday is an opportunity to upgrade your skills and get better at what you're doing.
